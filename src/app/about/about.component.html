                        I'm a passionate web developer with experience in front-end and back-end technologies. I specialize in building modern, responsive websites and applications. I believe in the power of the web to connect people and transform ideas into reality.

                      <p>
                        Over the years, I've had the privilege of working with amazing teams and clients, helping them create digital experiences that are not only functional but beautiful.

                        When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring new technologies, reading, or enjoying outdoor activities like hiking and biking.
